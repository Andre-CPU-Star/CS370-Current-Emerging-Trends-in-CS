1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

   The work that was done in the project was to complete code that would allow a player (the pirate) to learn the most efficient path through a maze. 
   The code that I was given was the initial code that set up the parameters of the maze. The code that I needed to change was the code that gave the 
   AI the information to assess the best path the end stage of the game. In the code I wrote I had to train the pirate using Q-Learning algorithm          which uses a q table to teach. In the end the pirate was able to find the most optimal path to complete the maze at first using a lot of exploration    and then once the pirate was getting closer changing over to exploitation after the pirate knew enough about the path to start making slight changes.
   
2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
     What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      Computer scientists create, edit, update, and amend the software of computer to achieve different goals. With there being so many different             programs and different goals computer scientist need to know a vast amount of knowledge to keep up with a world just keeps evolving faster and          faster. In our project AI technology is becoming larger and larger and that is only one part of what computer scientists do. This matters because       to keep creating modern technology software must be implemented to keep up with those changes and computer scientists are at the forefront of           making that happen.
   
     How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
      Approaching problems as a computer scientist can take varies approaches due to there being so many different problems possible and even more            solutions. The important fact to know is the proper steps to follow when encountering a problem. These steps should include first finding and           documenting the problem. The next step should be to disclose the issues in case someone knows of a quick solution. If a quick solution is               not possible then a trial-and-error approach will have to take place to find a solution to the problem. Once the solution has been                      found it is important to also document the solution, this way if the problem happens again there is a well-documented solution that can be              reused and will save people and the company time.
   
     What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
         Ethics tot eh end user should be one of the most important parts of a computer scientist. This is for many reasons, some of those reasons               include creating products that are what was promised. This is because if a product is released that is missing details the end user will lose           faith in our ability to create what was promised. The next responsibility is to create software that is safe and dependable. This means                 keeping personal data safe, the end users’ connection safe, and making sure the program can run efficiently and effectively to meet the end             user’s goals.
